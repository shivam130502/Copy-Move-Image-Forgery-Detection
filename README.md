# Copy Move Image Forgery Detection
Copy Move Image Forgery Detection is a Python project aimed at determining if an original image has been tampered with through editing. The project focuses on identifying a common type of forgery known as copy-move forgery, where a part of the image is copied and pasted elsewhere in the same image to conceal or alter information. To achieve this, it combines Block-based (DyWT - Discrete Wavelet Transform) and Keypoint-based (SIFT - Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithms, providing a comprehensive approach to forgery detection.

In the Block-based approach (DyWT), the image is divided into non-overlapping blocks, which are then analyzed for similarities using wavelet transforms to detect duplicated regions effectively, especially in smooth areas. On the other hand, the Keypoint-based approach (SIFT) focuses on identifying and extracting distinctive keypoints and descriptors that are invariant to scale and rotation, allowing the system to detect forgery even if the duplicated regions have undergone transformations like scaling or rotation.

The project leverages OpenCV for image preprocessing, feature extraction, and matching tasks, while NumPy is used for efficient data handling and matrix operations. Additionally, RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is implemented to eliminate false matches by ensuring that only consistent keypoint pairs are considered, significantly enhancing detection accuracy.

For improved user experience, the project includes a visualization module that highlights detected tampered areas directly on the image, making it easy for users to understand the results. The combination of block-based and keypoint-based methods, along with robust filtering techniques, ensures that the detection process is both accurate and reliable. This makes the project a valuable tool for verifying the authenticity of digital images, particularly in forensic analysis and digital media verification.
